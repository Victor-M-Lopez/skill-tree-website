			<p class="project_name">Circuit Assembly Skills Development</p>

			<p class="project_description">Objective:</p>
			<p class="description_text">
				The goal of this project is to learn how to assemble basic electronic
				circuits by combining various components such as resistors, capacitors,
				LEDs, and switches on a breadboard or perfboard. This project will help
				you understand how to create functional circuits by properly arranging
				and connecting components.
			</p>

			<p class="project_scope">project scope:</p>
			<p class="scope_text">
				Participants will practice assembling and testing basic circuits,
				building on their soldering skills to create more complex and functional
				electronic setups. The project focuses on the practical application of
				basic electronics theory and schematic reading, working with components
				in the following ways:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					Simple LED Circuit - Assemble and test a basic circuit with an LED,
					resistor, and battery.
				</li>
				<li>
					Series and Parallel Circuits - Explore how connecting components in
					series or parallel affects the circuit's behavior.
				</li>
				<li>
					Capacitor Charging Circuit - Assemble a circuit that demonstrates how
					capacitors charge and discharge over time.
				</li>
				<li>
					Switch-Controlled Circuit - Build a simple on/off circuit using a
					switch to control the flow of current to an LED or other component.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p class="delivery_text">By the end of the project, participants will:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Be able to assemble basic circuits on a breadboard or perfboard.
				</li>
				<li>
					Understand the function and arrangement of common electronic
					components.
				</li>
				<li>
					Gain the ability to read and interpret simple circuit diagrams
					(schematics).
				</li>
